            "question1": "What is Omnilux Contour?",
            "answer1": "<p>Based on the world’s leading Omnilux Medical light therapy technology, our Contour line is an FDA cleared, flexible, portable, and affordable home use device collection. The Contour line uses red and near infrared light emitting diodes (LEDs) to reduce fine lines and wrinkles and improve overall skin tone, firmness, and skin health.<\/p>",
            "enableFaq2": true,
            "question2": "How does it work?",
            "answer2": "<p>The Contour devices use optimized energy output and two clinically proven wavelengths of light (red and near-infrared) to work at a cellular level to stimulate new collagen and reduce fine lines, wrinkles, sun damage, and the visible signs of aging.<br\/><br\/>The red wavelength (633nm) reduces inflammation, pigmentation, and redness and helps prompt cellular repair and circulation for a more vibrant complexion.<br\/><br\/>The near-infrared wavelength (830nm) targets deeper fibroblast cells, stimulating new collagen and elastin production, resulting in plumper, firmer, more youthful looking skin.<\/p>",
            "enableFaq3": true,
            "question3": "What is the recommended treatment regimen for Contour?",
            "answer3": "<p>We recommend using the Contour devices 3-5 times per week for 4-6 weeks. After the initial 6 weeks, you should continue routine maintenance treatments as desired based on lifestyle and skincare needs, as everyone skin is different. Consistency is key, so find what works best for you!<\/p>",

            "question4": "How does Omnilux Contour differ from Omnilux Clear?",

Omnilux Clear is specifically designed to treat mild to moderate acne vulgaris and combines blue and red light. Although both devices have red light, they target two completely different skin concerns.<\/p>",
            "enableFaq5": true,
            "question5": "Can I use my Contour device every day?",
            "answer5": "<p>We recommend only using the devices 3-5x a week, as we have not studied the effect of using the device every day. Although there is little risk, we do not recommend using the device in any way that is not exactly as specified in these instructions for use.<\/p>",
            "enableFaq6": true,
            "question6": "Does LED light therapy really work?",

Omnilux devices have been specifically profiled in over 40 independent peer-reviewed published clinical studies of these studies, with applications ranging from skin rejuvenation, acne, pigmentation, and other common skin conditions.<\/p><p>Please note: Not all LED masks are created equal!

            "question4": "Should I use any serum\/creams or other skincare products underneath my device?",
            "answer4": "<p>We recommend completing treatments with a bare face, or using the specially formulated and designed Omnilux Hydrogel masks under your device. You don't want to create a barrier between your skin and the light with any unauthorized products. If additional hydration is desired during treatment, a light water-based serum is okay. Any other products could impact the amount of light reaching the skin and reduce effectiveness, could possibly cause a skin reaction, or may damage the Contour device itself.<\/p>",

            "question8": "How does Contour compare to the Omnilux Medical professional system?",
            "answer8": "<p>Although the output of professional units is much higher, the dose delivered during an at-home Contour treatment is very similar, as are the results! Think about it as a flashlight shining light on a wall – the closer you get to the wall, the brighter and more intense the light becomes. Because the Contour's LEDs are directly on the skin, it delivers a higher concentration of light.<\/p>",

The red wavelength can be found in the Skin Corrector, Eye Brightener, and Blemish Eraser devices.<br\/><br\/>The near-infrared wavelength (830nm) targets deeper fibroblast cells, stimulating new collagen and elastin production, resulting in plumper, firmer, more youthful looking skin. The red wavelength can be found in the Skin Corrector and Eye Brightener devices.<br\/><br\/>The blue wavelength (415nm) eliminates bacteria on the surface of the skin to neutralize acne flare ups.

            "question2": "What are the benefits of red, near-infrared and blue light therapy?",
            "answer2": "<p>Red light reduces inflammation, pigmentation, and redness and helps prompt cellular repair and circulation for a more vibrant complexion.<br\/><br\/>Near-infrared targets deeper fibroblast cells, stimulating new collagen and elastin production, resulting in plumper, firmer, more youthful looking skin.<br\/><br\/>Blue light eliminates bacteria on the surface of the skin to neutralize acne flare ups and helps control cell turnover helping to prevent clogged pores.<br\/><br\/>Studies show that these wavelengths are even more effective when used in certain combinations. For example, the Blemish Eraser device reduces inflammation and pigmentation with red light while simultaneously eliminating bacteria with blue light, resulting in a more effective acne treatment.<\/p>",

            "question3": "Can I use Eye Brightener, Skin Corrector, and Blemish Eraser at the same time?",

For example, you may use the Eye Brightener to treat around the eyes and the Blemish Eraser to treat a breakout on the forehead. However, we do not recommend treating the same exact area with two devices immediately after one another.<\/p>",
